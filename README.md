# DvtElevatorChallenge
This is a solution proposed by me to this challenge<br/><br/>
**Elevator Challenge**<br/>
Your task is to create a console application in C# using OOP principles that simulate the movement of elevators, with the goal being to move people as efficiently as possible.<br/><br/> 
The console application should provide the following features:<br/> 
**_show the status of the elevators, including which floor they are on, whether they are moving and in which direction, and how many people they are carrying_**
**_provides a way to interact with the elevators, including calling them to a specific floor and setting the number of people waiting on each floor_**<br/><br/> 
The console application should be able to offer the following:<br/>
**_support for multiple floors_**<br/>
**_support for multiple elevators_**<br/><br/> 
**Hints**<br/>
Given a pool of elevators, the program should send the nearest available elevator to that person.<br/><br/>
**Extra Credit**<br/>
For extra credit, allow a weight limit, expressed as a number of people, to be imposed on the elevators. You can assume every elevator in the simulation has the same weight limit.
Donâ€™t forget about SOLID and DRY principles.
Also include unit tests for the code you have developed.

**A few considerations when you run the solution**<br/>
When the elevators are installed (the constructor for the building is called) all elevators are at ground level (floor 0)<br/>
There are some constants defined for the length of the list containing the list of elevators (each elevator has a letter from the alphabet assigned)
so the maximum size is 26<br/>
Also we can have above and underground floors (I have defined some boundaries for that, specifically for the maximum floor number).In this case, is 160 floors<br/>
Since on each floor there are some people waiting for the elevator, there is a maximum number of people that can be accommodated on each floor (the number is 80)<br/>
